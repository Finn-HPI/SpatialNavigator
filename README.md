# Spatial Navigator

This app was created using [`@capacitor/create-app`](https://github.com/ionic-team/create-capacitor-app),
and comes with a very minimal shell for building an app.

## Running this example

First install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can build the application and preview it:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
